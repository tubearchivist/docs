# User Settings Page
Accessible at `/settings/user/` of your **Tube Archivist** instance, this page holds all the settings that control the look and feel of the application. This is configurable for each individual user of your instance.

Click on **Update User Configurations** at the bottom of the page to apply your configurations.

## Color scheme
Switch between the "easy on the eyes" dark theme and the "burning" bright theme.

## Archive View
- **Page Size**: Defines how many results get displayed on each page. This value is used for all archive views.

## Show Help Text
Activating that will show helpful explanations, sometimes with examples through the interface. Untoggle that to hide that if you are familiar with this project and want to _unclutter_ the interface.
