# User Management

For now, **Tube Archivist** is a single user application. You can create multiple users with different names and passwords, they will share the same videos and permissions but some interface configurations are on a per user basis. *More is on the roadmap*.

## Superuser
The first user gets created with the environment variables **TA_USERNAME** and **TA_PASSWORD** from your docker-compose file. That first user will automatically have *superuser* privileges. 

## Admin Interface
When logged in from your *superuser* account, you are able to access the admin interface from the settings page or at `/admin/`. This interface holds all functionality for user management.

## Create additional users
From the admin interface when you click on *Accounts* you will get a list of all users. From there you can create additional users by clicking on *Add Account*, provide a name and confirm password and click on *Save* to create the user.

## Changing users
You can delete or change permissions and password of a user by clicking on the username from the *Accounts* list page and follow the interface from there. Changing the password of the *superuser* here will overwrite the password originally set with the environment variables.

## Reset
Delete all user configurations by deleting the file `cache/db.sqlite3` and restart the container. This will create the superuser again from the environment variables.

!!! note "BE AWARE"
    Future improvements here will most likely require such a reset.
