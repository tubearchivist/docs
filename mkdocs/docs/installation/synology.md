!!! abstract "Installation Instructions - Community Guides"
    These are beginner's guides/installation instructions for additional platforms generously provided by users of these platforms. When in doubt, verify the details with the [project README](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist#installing). If you see any issues here while using these instructions, please contribute. 

!!! danger "Compatibility Problems"
	- As Synology is running their old kernel (currently 4.4.302+), you might face problems running Elasticsearch on your device, as newer Elasticsearch version require kernel modules not available and not backported by Synology.
	- You will see errors like: `seccomp unavailable` and `CONFIG_SECCOMP not compiled into kernel`, `CONFIG_SECCOMP and CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER are needed`.
	- Workaround is to pin the Elasticsearch image to an older version, not requiring these modules: `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.14.3`.
	- That is likely going to break in the future, as this project develops, new functionality might depend on new ES versions.

!!! warning "Outdated"
	  Please review these instructions and update it to the changes introduced in [v0.5.0](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

There are several different methods to install **Tube Archivist** on Synology platforms. This will focus on the available `docker` package manager implementation for Synology 7.1 and prior.<!--  and `docker-compose` implementations. -->

!!! note
    Synology Package Manager for 7.2 and later should be able to follow the instructions below or create a project using the [docker compose installation instructions.](docker-compose.md)

### Prepare Directories/Folders

Before we setup **Tube Archivist**, we need to setup the directories/folders. You are assumed to be logged into the Synology NAS with a properly permissioned user.

#### 1. Docker Base Folder
   1. Open the `File Station` utility.
   2. Click on the **CreateðŸ”½** button and choose *Create New Shared Folder*.
   3. **Name** the folder "Docker".
   4. Add a **Description**.
   5. Select the **Volume Location**. 
   > !!! note
         By default, this will be where all persistent data is stored. Change the folders as best meets your requirements.
   6. Select the appropriate options from the remaining checkbox configurations.

   9. Click the **Next** button.
   10. On the **Advanced Settings** page, you can select the *Enable data checksum for advanced data integrity* setting. This may cause a performance impact, but will allow for potential file self-healing. **This cannot be changed later.**
   > !!! warning
         This is not recommended as we will be hosting databases within this folder.
   11. If you are enabling a quota for how large the folder can get, you can select the *Enabled shared folder quota* setting and choose the maximum size this folder can grow. This can be changed later.
   12. Click the **Next** button.
   13. Confirm the settings, then click the **Apply** button. This will create the folder.

### 6. Post-Installation Monitoring

1. After the containers have been configured and started, you can go to the **Container** tab and monitor the containers.
2. To review the logs to ensure that the system has started successfully, select the `tubearchivist` container and click on the **Details** button. In the new window, go to the **Log** tab. Monitor the logs until either an error occurs or the message `celery@tubearchivist ready.` is in the logs. This may take a few minutes, especially for a first time setup.
   
   > !!! note "Reviewing Logs"
         Synology Docker presents the logs in a paginated format, showing in historical order (oldest first).
         If you are not seeing the logs update, check if there are additional pages.

3. After it has started, go to the location provided in the `TA_HOST`. This should give you the standard **Tube Archivist** login screen.
<!-- 
### Docker-Compose Setup -->
<!-- This section is a Work In Progress -->

**From there, you should be able to start up your containers and you're good to go!**

### Synology Docker Upgrade
When a new version of the image is available, you can use the following steps to more easily upgrade your previous instance.

!!! failure "`latest` Tag Required"
    If you did not use the `latest` tag, you may have some variances in your upgrade steps. Those are detailed below these instructions.
1. Go to the Registry Tab and download the newest instance of the `:latest` tag, as seen in the Installation Instructions earlier.
2. Go to Image Tab and confirm that you have the newer version available.
3. Stop the running `tubearchivist` container.
4. Click on the **ActionðŸ”½** button and choose "Reset".
5. This will load the newer image we downloaded earlier. This should not delete any files if all of your volumes were setup correctly.
6. If it doesn't start automatically, start the `tubearchivist` container. Monitor the upgrade in the logs and confirm that the service starts up successfully.
7. Once you are able to login successfully to the web page for **Tube Archivist**, you have successfully upgraded your container!

!!! success "If you did not use the `latest` tag for the `tubearchivist` container, then you will instead do the following:"
   1. Shut down the old container.
   2. Download the new image.
   3. Follow the Installation instructions again *for just the Tube Archivist image*, using the same configurations as the existing container. It'll have to be named slightly differently.
   4. After the image is now running and the upgrade of the backend files occurs, shut down the new container. Rename or delete the old container. Rename the new container to have the intended name.

!!! info "Linking Upgrade Importance"
    Links are incredibly important if you upgrade or change the ES or Redis container images. You will either need to remove the links, create the new containers, then re-add the links or rebuild all of the images with the same instructions as Installation, starting at Step 3.
