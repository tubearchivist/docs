## General Navigation

* Clicking on a video title brings you to the dedicated video page and shows additional details.
* Clicking on a video thumbnail opens the video player and starts streaming the selected video.
* Clicking on the search icon <img src="assets/icon-search.png?raw=true" alt="gridview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> will open a dedicated search page to search over your complete index.
* The pagination - if available - builds links for up to 10'000 results, use the search, sort or filter functionality to find what you are looking for.


An empty checkbox icon <img src="assets/icon-unseen.png?raw=true" alt="unseen icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> will show for videos you haven't marked as watched. Click on it and the icon will change to a filled checkbox <img src="assets/icon-seen.png?raw=true" alt="seen icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> indicating it as watched - click again to revert.

When available the <img src="assets/icon-gridview.png?raw=true" alt="gridview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> gridview icon will display the list in a grid. A grid row holds 3 items by default, use the <img src="assets/icon-add.png?raw=true" alt="listview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> icon to add more or the <img src="assets/icon-substract.png?raw=true" alt="listview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> icon to remove items per row, depending on your screen size. The <img src="assets/icon-listview.png?raw=true" alt="listview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> listview icon will arrange the items in a list. The sort icon <img src="assets/icon-sort.png?raw=true" alt="listview icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> will open additional sort options.

You can control the video player with the following keyboard shortcuts:

- `?`: Show help
- `m`: toggle mute
- `c`: toggle subtitles if available
- `>`: increase playback speed
- `<`: decrease playback speed
- `←` (left arrow): jump back 5 seconds
